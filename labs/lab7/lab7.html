		<div class="title">Lab 7</div>

		<div class="section">Extended deadline</div>

		<p>You will have extra time to work on this lab since the midterm is this week.</p>

		<p>For students with the Tuesday lab section, this lab is due on February 27.</p>

		<p>For students with the Thursday lab section, this lab is due on Match 1.</p>

		<div class="section">Program summary</div>

		<p>You will create a program that will "remember" definitions of words or phrases, it will do so by storing words/phrases and their associated definitions into a file named "definitions.txt".</p>

		<div class="section">Program compilation</div>

		<p>Name your source file "define.cpp" and name your program "define" by compiling it with the following command:</p>

		<code>
g++ -o define define.cpp
		</code>

		<div class="section">Program usage</div>

		<p>If <tt>define</tt> is ran with 1 command-line argument, it will display the definition of that word/phrase specified by that argument. For example, if "definitions.txt" contained the definition "a named object" for "variable", then the command:</p>

		<code>
./define "variable"
		</code>

		<p>would display:</p>

		<code>
a named object
		</code>

		<p>If <tt>define</tt> is ran with 2 command-line arguments, it will create a new definition or replace an existing one in the file "definitions.txt". For example, the command:</p>

		<code>
./define "class" "a user-defined type"
		</code>

		<p>creates a new definition for "class" and the command <tt>./define "class"</tt> can now be used to look up that definition at a later time.</p>

		<p>You may add informational messages to your program such as "Definition created.", "Definition updated.", or "Definition not found" but these are optional.</p>

		<div class="section">Implementation hint</div>

		<p>One way you can implement this program is to load the defintions from the file into a <tt>map&lt;string, string&gt;</tt>, from here the definitions can easily be modified through the map. Before the program terminates, the updated definitions in the map should be saved to the file.</p>
