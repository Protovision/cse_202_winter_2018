		<div class="title">Derived Classes</div>

		<div class="subsection">Review of classes</div>

		<p>Before covering derived classes, it is important that you remember what a class is.</p>

		<p>A class is a user-defined type. When designing a class, what you can put inside of it are called members. There are three kinds of members you can have in a class:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Data members: Created as variable declarations inside the class</li>
			<li>Member functions: Created as function declarations inside the class</li>
			<li>Nested types: Created from the definitions of classes, type aliases, and enumerations inside the class</li>
		</ul>

		<code>
class A {
public:
	int b;
	void c() {}
	double d(int x) { return x / 2.0; }
	class E {};
	typedef bool F;
};
		</code>

		<p>In the example above, this arbitrary class A has: 1 data member, b; 2 member functions: c and d; and 2 nested types, E and F.</p>

		<p>When using this class, the operator <tt>::</tt> is used for accessing nested types and the operator <tt>.</tt> is used for accessing data members and member functions:</p>

		<code>
A o;			// Variable o has type A
A::F p = true;		// Variable p has type A::F which is an alias for bool
o.b = 4;		// Accessing the member b from o and assigning 4 to it.
o.c();			// Accessing the member function c from o and calling it.
		</code>

		<p>The access modes define the accessibility of certain class members:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><tt>private</tt>: Only member functions can access the declared-after members.</li>
			<li><tt>protected</tt>: Member functions and member functions of derived classes can access the declared-after members.</li>
			<li><tt>public</tt>: Any function can access the declared-after members.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A class can contain multiple access mode specifiers, allowing some members to be private, some to be protected, and others to be public.</p>

		<div class="subsection">Derived classes and Base classes</div>

		<p>When designing a class, you can "combine" it with an existing class so that every object of your class-type will also contain all the members of that existing class.</p> 

		<code>
struct A {
	int a, b;
	void c() {}
};

struct B : A {
	int d, e;
};
		</code>

		<p>In the above example, the B class contains the public members a, b, c, d, and e. The <tt>: A</tt> part after <tt>struct B</tt> is known as the base clause, it is an optional clause for class declarations and it is used to specify the base classes for this class.</p>

		<p>A class that has base classes is itself a derived class of those base classes and every object of this derived class contains one subobject for each base class.</p>

		<p>Since <tt>struct</tt> is used instead of <tt>class</tt>, the members are public by default and the members of the base classes, which are accessible from the derived class, will be publically accessible through objects of this class.</p>

		<p>The act of specifying one or more base classes within a class declaration is known as "inheritance". In our inheritance example, we say that B "inherits" from A. There are different types of inheritance with regard to access mode: public inheritance, private, inheritance, and protected inheritance.</p>

		<p>By default, a class declared using <tt>struct</tt> uses public inheritance on it's specified base classes and a class declared using <tt>class</tt> uses private inheritance on it's specified base classes.</p>

		<div class="section">Types of inheritance</div>

		<p>The syntax of a C++ class declaration is:</p>

		<code>
class-key name base-clause { member-specification }
		</code>

		<p>class-key can be "class" or "struct", name is the name of the class, base-clause is an optional clause beginning with ':' and followed by a comma separated list of base specifiers where each base specifier is the name of a class to be used as a base class optionally preceeded with an access specifier of "public", "private", or "protected".</p>

		<p>In the base clause, when a base class is specified with the access specifier <tt>public</tt>, all public inherited members will have public access mode and all protected inherited members will have protected access mode in the current class, this is known as public inheritance. Public inheritance is the default inheritance mode for derived classes declared with a class key of <tt>struct</tt>.</p>

		<p>A base class specifier of <tt>private</tt> means that the inherited members will have private access mode in the current class; this is the default inheritance mode for derived classes declared with a class key of <tt>class</tt>.</p>

		<p>A base class specifier of <tt>protected</tt> means that the inherited members will have protected access mode in the current class.</p>

		<p>Remember that a class can control what members it allows a potential derived class to inherit. Private members cannot be inherited, public or protected members can be inherited.</p>

		<div class="section">Examples of inheritance</div>

		<code>
/* 
 * Class A has protected data members a, b, and c
 */
class A {
protected:
	int a, b, c;
};

/* 
 * Class B has private data members x, y, and z together with private data
 * members a, b, and c inherited from class A
 */
class B : A {
	int x, y, z;
};
		</code>

		<code>
/*
 * Class A has private data member y, public data member y, and protected 
 * data member z
 */
class A {
	int x;
public:
	int y;
protected:
	int z;
};

/*
 * Class B has public data members i and y and protected data member z.
 */
class B : public A {
public:
	int i;
};
		</code>

		<code>
/*
 * Class A has public data member a and private data member b
 */
class A {
public:
	int a;
private:
	int b;
};

/*
 * Class B has public data member x, protected data member a which was
 * inherited from class A, and private data member y.
 */
class B : protected A {
public:
	int x;
private:
	int y;
};

/*
 * Class C has public data members i and j together with the private data 
 * members x and a which were inherited from class B
 */
struct C : private B {
	int i, j;
};
		</code>
