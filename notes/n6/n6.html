		<div class="title">Assignment and operator overloading</div>

		<div class="section">Assignment</div>

		<p>Even though copy initialization and copy assignment both use the simple assignment operator, they are different:</p>

		<code>
T object = other;	// Copy initialization
object = other;		// Copy assignment
		</code>

		<p>For non-class types, they both have the same effect: the value of <tt>other</tt> is copied and assigned to <tt>object</tt>, replacing whatever value <tt>object</tt> already had.</p>

		<p>The potential presence of a copy constructor or copy assignment operator in <tt>T</tt> can alter what happens during copy initialization or copy assignment.</p>

		<code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct copy_me {
	copy_me(const copy_me&amp; other)
	{
		std::cout &lt;&lt; "Copy initialization of type copy_me" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	}

	copy_me&amp; operator=(const copy_me&amp; other)
	{
		std::cout &lt;&lt; "Copy assignment of type copy_me" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
		return *this;
	}
};

int main()
{
	copy_me object1;
	copy_me object2 = object1;

	object1 = object2;
	return 0;
}
		</code>

		<p>In this example, the class <tt>copy_me</tt> has a copy constructor and a copy assignment operator. The expression <tt>copy_me object2 = object1;</tt> results in the copy constructor for <tt>object2</tt> being invoked. The expression <tt>object1 = object2;</tt> results in the copy assignment operator for <tt>object1</tt> being invoked.</p>

		<p>Notice the keyword <tt>struct</tt> used instead of <tt>class</tt>. In C++ the only difference between <tt>struct</tt> and <tt>class</tt> is that the default member access for <tt>struct</tt> is <tt>public</tt> while the default member access for <tt>class</tt> is <tt>private</tt>. <tt>struct</tt> is short for structure and all structures are classes and can also have member functions, constructors, private members, and member operators.</p>

		<p>Copy assignment operators should always have one parameter that is a constant reference to an object of the same type and they should always return a reference to the current object being assigned to, which is always <tt>*this</tt>.</p>

		<div class="section">Operator overloading</div>

		<p>Creating a user-defined copy assignment operator inside of a class is one example of operator overloading. Other operators can be overloaded, such as the addition operator or the subscript operator.</p>

		<p>Let's remake our the <tt>card</tt> again and instead of using strings, we will use <tt>unsigned int</tt> to represent the rank and suit:</p>

		<code>
struct card {
	unsigned int rank;
	unsigned int suit;
};
		</code>

		<p>If I have two objects <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> of type <tt>card</tt>, the expression <tt>a == b</tt> would be invalid unless I overload the "equal to" operator. One way to do that would be to overload it as a member function:</p>

		<code>
struct card {
	unsigned int rank;
	unsigned int suit;

	bool operator==(const card&amp; other) const
	{
		return rank == other.rank &amp;&amp; suit == other.suit;
	}
};
		</code>

		<p>You can also overload it as a free function:</p>

		<code>
struct card {
	unsigned int rank;
	unsigned int suit;
};

bool operator==(const card&amp; a, const card&amp; b)
{
	return a.rank == b.rank &amp;&amp; a.suit == b.suit;
}
		</code>

		<p>If I wanted to allow the card to be inserted into an output stream, I can also overload the insertion operator for <tt>std::ostream</tt>:</p>

		<code>
std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const card&amp; c)
{
	return (os &lt;&lt; "card{" &lt;&lt; c.rank &lt;&lt; ',' &lt;&lt; c.suit &lt;&lt; '}');
}
		</code>

		<p>Now the expression <tt>std::cout &lt;&lt; c</tt> for some <tt>card c</tt> is valid.</p>

		<p>There are many operators you can overload for a class, not all of them can be overloaded as free functions, some of them can only be overloaded as member functions of the class, and a few operators cannot be overloaded at all.</p>

		<p>See <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/expressions#Operators">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/expressions#Operators</a> for a list of operators and their signatures for overloading.</p>
