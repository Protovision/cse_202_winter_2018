		<div class="title">Dynamic memory management</div>

		<p>You have been briefly introduced to <i>new-expressions</i> and <i>delete-expressions</i> in <a href="../n13/n13.html">"Storage Durations"</a>, these expressions deal with objects located in dynamic storage. You should know that a new-expression creates an object that has dynamic storage duration and a delete-expression destroys an object that was created with a new-experssion. The primary reason to use <tt>new</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> is for implementing a container or data structure such as: <tt>std::vector</tt>, <tt>std::map</tt>, and <tt>std::list</tt>.</p>

		<div class="section">Allocation and deallocation</div>

		<p>Let's dive deeper into what a new-expression is actually doing. A new-expression creates an object first by allocating storage for the object and then by initializing that storage. The storage that an object occupies is composed of a contiguous sequence of bytes; the unique address of the first byte of an object's storage is the memory location of that object.</p>

		<p>All types of storage in C++ are composed of a contiguous sequence of bytes with each byte having a unique address (even across different types of storage). The particular type of storage that a new-expression allocates is dynamic storage, but the new-expression does not do this directly. The new-expression delegates the task of allocating dynamic storage to the <i>global allocation functions</i>: <tt>::operator new</tt> and <tt>::operator new[]</tt>.</p>

		<p>The global allocation functions only allocate dynamic storage; unlike the new-expressions, they do not initialize the dynamic storage that they allocate. To prove this, you may run the following program:</p>

		<code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

struct C {
	
	C()
	{
		cout &lt;&lt; '[' &lt;&lt; this &lt;&lt; "] C::C()" &lt;&lt; endl;
	}

	~C()
	{
		cout &lt;&lt; '[' &lt;&lt; this &lt;&lt; "] C::~C()" &lt;&lt; endl;
	}

};

int main()
{
	C* x1 = ::new C;
	cout &lt;&lt; "x1 = " &lt;&lt; x1 &lt;&lt; endl;
	::delete x1;

	C* x2 = (C*)::operator new(sizeof(C));
	cout &lt;&lt; "x2 = " &lt;&lt; x2 &lt;&lt; endl;
	::operator delete(x2);

	return 0;
}
		</code>

		<p>The output will be something like:</p>

		<code>
[0x562aff849e70] C::C()
x1 = 0x562aff849e70
[0x562aff849e70] C::~C()
x2 = 0x562aff849e70
		</code>

		<p>You can see here that the constructor for C was only called during the new-expression; <tt>::operator new</tt> did not call the constructor for C. The delete-expression called the destructor for C, but the <i>global deallocation function</i> <tt>::operator delete</tt> did not.</p>

		<p>Also note that <tt>::</tt> was used in front of the new and delete-expressions, it is possible to override the allocation and deallocation functions that new and delete-expressions use for a particular type; by explicitly using <tt>::new</tt> and <tt>::delete</tt>, the new and delete-expressions will use the global allocation functions provided by C++.</p>

		<p>If you ever need to allocate storage without initializating it, consider using the global allocation and deallocation functions instead of the new and delete-expressions.</p>

		<p>To allocate an uninitialized array, the <tt>::operator new[]</tt> function should be used:</p>

		<code>
int* p = (int*)::operator new[](100 * sizeof(int));
		</code>

		<p>The code above allocates an uninitialized array of 100 <tt>int</tt> and stores a pointer to this array in <tt>p</tt>. To deallocate an array that was allocated with <tt>::operator new[]</tt>, you must call <tt>::operator delete[]</tt> like: <tt>::operator delete[](p)</tt>.</p>

		<div class="section">Construction and destruction</div>

		<p>It is possible to manually initialize an object, whether or not it has already been initialized:</p>

		<code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int x = 42;
	cout &lt;&lt; "x:  " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
	::new(&amp;x) int;
	cout &lt;&lt; "x after default-initialization: " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
	::new(&amp;x) int();
	cout &lt;&lt; "x after value-initialization: " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
	return 0;
}
		</code>
		
		<p>The output of the above program is:</p>

		<code>
x: 42
x after default-initialization: 42
x after value-initialization: 0
		</code>

		<p>The new-expression used in the form of <tt>::new(&amp;x) int;</tt> default-initializes an already allocated object located at <tt>&amp;x</tt>. <tt>::new(&amp;x) int();</tt> value-initializes an already allocated object located at <tt>&amp;x</tt>.</p>

		<p>The output of this program shows that default-initialization does nothing for non-class types while value-initialization zero-initializes a non-class-type object by setting all the bytes in that object's storage to zero.</p>

		<p>The following program demonstrates the manual allocation, construction, destruction, and deallocation of a class-type object:</p>

		<code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

struct T {
	int x;
	T(int x)
	{
		cout &lt;&lt; "T::T()" &lt;&lt; endl;
		this-&gt;x = x;
	}
	~T()
	{
		cout &lt;&lt; "T::~T()" &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
};	
int main()
{
	T* p = (T*)::operator new(sizeof(T));
	::new(p) T(42);
	cout &lt;&lt; "p-&gt;x: " &lt;&lt; p-&gt;x &lt;&lt; endl;
	p-&gt;T::~T();
	::operator delete(p);
	return 0;
}
		</code>

		<p>The code in the main function does the same as if the code was:</p>
		
		<code>
T* p = ::new T(42);
cout &lt;&lt; "p-&gt;x: " &lt;&lt; p-&gt;x &lt;&lt; endl;
::delete p;
		</code>

		<p>The statement <tt>::new(p) T(42)</tt> direct-initializes an object pointed to by p with the value 42. Since the object is a class-type, it's constructor will be called with 42 as the argument.</p>

		<p>The statement <tt>p-&gt;T::~T()</tt> calls the destructor of an object of type <tt>T</tt> through it's pointer <tt>p</tt>; a statement like this can only be used on class-type objects unless you are writing code for a template.</p>
