		<div class="title">Conversions</div>

		<div class="section">Implicit conversions</div>

		<p>Consider the code fragment <tt>int x = 3.5;</tt>. Even though the initializer value is 3.5, the initial value of x actually becomes 3. The first reason is because an integer object cannot store fractional values. The second reason is because 3.5 underwent <i>implicit conversion</i> during initialization.</p>

		<p>Implicit conversion also happens when you invoke a function that expects a <tt>double</tt> argument, but you provide an <tt>int</tt> argument instead. An example of this happening is when an expression like <tt>std::cos(3)</tt> gets evaluated; the integer value <tt>3</tt> gets implicitly converted to the floating-point value <tt>3.0</tt>.</p>

		<p>The implicit conversions that happen between built-in types are known as the standard conversions.</p>

		<p>Most of the standard conversions are common sense (such as the integer value 42 becoming 42.0 when being assigned to a <tt>double</tt>). Some are less common sense (such as non-zero values becoming <tt>true</tt> when converted to <tt>bool</tt> and vice versa).</p>
		<div class="section">Explicit conversions</div>

		<p>An explicit conversion can be performed by the programmer. One way to do this is to have some expression preceeded by a type enclosed in parenthesis, for example <tt>(double)x</tt> is an explicit conversion of x to a value of type <tt>double</tt>. This method is known as <i>cast notation</i>, in this method we say that <tt>x</tt> is being "casted" to <tt>double</tt>.</p>

		<p><i>functional notation</i> is another way to make an explicit conversion. The expression <tt>double(x)</tt> also creates a value of type <tt>double</tt> from x (converting the value of x if necessary).</p>

		<div class="section">Converting constructor</div>

		<p>A converting constructor is a constructor with a single parameter of a type that is different from the class that the constructor is for.</p>

		<p>Here is a very abstract example of a class with a converting constructor:</p>
		<code>
class A {
public:
	A(bool b)
	{

	}
};
		</code>

		<p>This class does nothing, but the following statements and expressions are now valid due to the presence of a boolean converting constructor in <tt>A</tt>:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><tt>A a = true;</tt></li>
			<li><tt>A a(false);</tt></li>
			<li><tt>A(true);</tt></li>
			<li><tt>(A)true;</tt></li>
		</ul>

		<p>When an class type object gets initialized with a value of a different type, the appropriate converting constructor gets invoked. You can have multiple converting constructors if there is more than one type that can be converted to your class.</p>

		<div class="subsection"><tt>explicit</tt> specifier</div>

		<p>When a converting constructor for some class <tt>T</tt> is preceeded with the keyword <tt>explicit</tt>, then that converting constructor cannot be invoked through implicit conversion: an expression such as <tt>T x = U()</tt> becomes invalid; instead, direct initialization (<tt>T x(U());</tt>) or explicit conversion (<tt>T x = (T)U();</tt>) should be used to get the same effect.</p>

		<p><tt>explicit</tt> can also be used with copy constructors to disallow copy initialization but still allow direct initialization.</p>

		<code>
class A { 
public:
        explicit A(int b) {}
};

class B { 
public:
        B(int x) {}
};

int main()
{
        A a(12);        // OK: Direct initialization
        A b = A(4);     // OK: Copy initialization from direct initialized nameless temporary
        A c = 10;       // Compiler error: explicit disallows implicit conversion from 10 to A

        B d = 8;        // OK: B's converting constructor has no explicit specifier. 
                        // Copy initialization from nameless temporary created from implicit conversion
                        // of 8 allowed.

        return 0;
}
